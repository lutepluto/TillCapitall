            <p class="tc-article-text">We are mainly focused on 6 internet related industries , we believe there are massive opportunities for disrupting traditional industries. Mobile technology includes big data, quantitative techniques, tracing devices, wearable technology, tele-presence technology, ubiquitous screens, 3D printing technology, artificial intelligence, and electronic currency. One of the start-ups coming out of these marginal sectors today may very well subvert “BAT” within the next 5 years.</p>

            <h2><img src="img/game.png" class="img-responsive pull-left top-margin-minus-4">&nbsp;Internet Entertainment</h2>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Current Status</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Currently there are 1 billion mobile devices being used worldwide and this number is increasing.  Mobile gaming usage and monetisation of those users is increasing, mobile gaming, and by extension, mobile entertainment’s public acceptance is on the rise.  At the end of 2013, China has more than 300 million mobile gaming users, this and the shrinking PC market means massive opportunities for comic, movies, gaming, toys and other derivative entertainment products everywhere on the value chain.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Future Expectations</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Internet based gaming is still the driver of interactive entertainment business.  Gaming has evolved from client end to web based to mobile gaming but the future will be interactive entertainment.  The current value chain for gaming is only viable in the short to medium run, but in the long run, game based movie, movies, comic and other derivative products will drive growth.  Therefore, we are very keen to incubate companies with this interactive platform market in mind.</p>

            <h2><img src="img/education.png" class="img-responsive pull-left top-margin-minus-5">&nbsp;Internet Education</h2>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Current Status</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Internet is disrupting traditional education methods and making educational resources free for everyone.  A key highlight for this industry is high user stickiness and high demand in the Chinese space.  The overall Chinese online education market in 2014 is expected to be more than 130 billion RMB.  Of this, pre-school market is worth 2.9 billion RMB, K12 worth 28.3 billion RMB, higher education worth 56.4billion RMB and professional education market expected to be worth 35.2 billion RMB.  Some problems that moving online can solve include, location and travel issues, information asymmetry and others – this is a huge market.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Future Expectations</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">We expect technology will help students realise lifetime data collection and personalised curriculums based on data collected.  The monetisation model is expected to follow the “freemium” model where basic services are free and students are charged for value added services.  Some key feature technologies will allow real time feedback, continuous monitoring and the trend is expected to move towards UGC, richer content, and social learning etc.</p>

            <h2><img src="img/health.png" class="img-responsive pull-left top-margin-minus-4">&nbsp;Internet Healthcare</h2>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Current Status</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Market characterised by huge demand and high degree of information asymmetry.  The latter feature of the Chinese market massively reduced the user experience faced by Chinese patients.  Taking healthcare online can mitigate this information problem and we are seeing great advances in terms of electronic patient data keeping, distant diagnostic tools and others coming out of mature markets like America.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Future Expectations</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">We are seeing the beginning of the age of smart healthcare.  Features of this new age includes continuous patient information collection, monitor, diagnosis and analysis.  This is done through wearable technology, big data analysis, and mobile internet.  Disease and illness database will be shared, discussed and analysed by a greater number of experts and people will be more aware of their body than ever before.  We are looking for a team that can help them do that better, faster and smarter.</p>

            <h2><img src="img/finance.png" class="img-responsive pull-left top-margin-minus-5">&nbsp;Internet Finance</h2>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Current Status</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">The foundation of internet finance is the removal of intermediation.  Information asymmetry is also a problem in the finance industry and a barrier for inclusive finance that involves everyone.  Due to massive base of non-professionals potential participates in the financial market, traditional institutions cannot but most often don’t want to break the current paradigm.  We believe internet finance will change that and those that can tab this massive market will be well rewarded.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Future Expectations</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Financial disintermediation is the trend we have picked up.  This means financial market will become more about direct financing with some intermediation.  Specifically, we expect mobile financing, cloud financing and big data financing to be key areas of focus for this industry.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Current Status</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">We expect this market to be worth 6 billion US by 2016.  Our clothes and accessories will be an extension of us intellectually and in the sense of data interactions.  Communication, life style and overall living standards will evolve.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Future Expectations</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Then trend in wearable technology is curated  features and platformisation.  Rich features means richer user experience and an open platform means more customisation and unique features and experiences.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Current Status</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">Connectivity is on the rise and this segment is a key entry point for a massive market.  Big data is a crucial support required by traditional industries in terms of business model upgrade.  Smart home ware, therefore, offers a very attractive foundation for future developments due to its ability to generate massive amounts of data.</p>

            <h3>-&nbsp;Future Expectations</h3>
            <p class="tc-article-text">This technology will bring connectivity to every appliance in the home.  After appliances is connected, smart phones, tablets and mobile devices will complete this smart ecosystem in that the user will be able to control and manipulate his/her home ware from afar and will also be able to optimise their entire living environment.</p>
